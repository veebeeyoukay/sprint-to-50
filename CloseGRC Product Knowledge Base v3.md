---

## HOW TO USE THIS KNOWLEDGE BASE

**Instructions for Claude:** When answering questions about CloseGRC, reference this knowledge base to provide tactical, actionable advice focused on validation, efficiency, and rapid iteration. Prioritize speed to market and practical implementation over theory. Keep responses brief unless specifically asked for detailed explanations.

**Context:** Solo founder in validation phase, no venture backing, building B2B SaaS for technology companies selling to regulated enterprises. Target persona: sales leaders and founders.

**Response Guidelines:**
- Use proven Silicon Valley playbooks and frameworks from Harvard, Wharton, MIT, Stanford
- Focus on immediate actionable steps
- Suggest AI automation opportunities where relevant
- Consider constraints: solo founder, limited resources, need for speed
- Default to tactical over strategic unless asked

---

## VALIDATION PHASE

### Q: What's the fastest way to validate CloseGRC's core value proposition?
**A:** Run the "Mom Test" interviews (Rob Fitzpatrick): Ask about current compliance processes, not your solution. Focus on:
- "Walk me through your last enterprise deal that got stuck in security review"
- "What happened the last time you lost a deal due to compliance?"
- "How much revenue is currently stalled in your pipeline due to GRC requirements?"

Target 10 sales leaders at B2B tech companies ($10-50M ARR) selling to banks/healthcare. Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator + Loom videos for 15% response rate.

### Q: How do I know if I've found product-market fit signals?
**A:** Steve Blank's Customer Development metrics:
- 3+ customers say they'd be "very disappointed" if CloseGRC disappeared
- 40%+ of interviewed prospects mention the same specific pain unprompted
- At least 1 prospect offers to pay before you've built anything
- Sales cycles shorten with each iteration

### Q: What's the minimum viable feature set for validation?
**A:** Y Combinator's "concierge MVP" approach:
1. Manual GRC assessment template (Google Sheets)
2. Slack bot for compliance status updates
3. Basic Zapier integration to their CRM
Start manual, automate only after 3 paying customers.

## TIME PRIORITIZATION

### Q: How should I allocate my time daily as a solo founder?
**A:** Peter Thiel's "One Thing" framework:
- **Before noon:** Customer development (validation phase) or product (post-validation)
- **Afternoon:** Everything else
- **Current split:** 60% customer interviews, 20% MVP building, 20% operations

### Q: What tasks should I automate immediately with AI agents?
**A:** Focus on repetitive, high-frequency tasks:
1. **Lead qualification:** Build GPT agent to score inbound leads based on ICP
2. **Meeting scheduling:** Cal.com + AI email responder
3. **Competitor monitoring:** Apify scraper + Claude for weekly summaries
4. **Content generation:** Interview transcription → blog post pipeline

### Q: When should I say no to opportunities?
**A:** Warren Buffett's 5/25 rule - List 25 goals, circle top 5, avoid the other 20 at all costs. For CloseGRC:
- **Say yes to:** Direct customer feedback, enterprise pilot opportunities
- **Say no to:** Conferences, features outside core use case, partnership discussions before 10 customers

## GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY

### Q: What's the most efficient GTM motion for CloseGRC?
**A:** Product-Led Sales (PLS) hybrid - Atlassian/Slack model:
1. **Free tier:** Basic compliance checklist generator
2. **Self-serve:** $299/month for teams <10
3. **Sales-assisted:** $2-5k/month for enterprise
Hook with free tool, expand through usage.

### Q: How do I create urgency without venture backing?
**A:** Use regulation deadlines and "cost of delay" messaging:
- "Every month of delay = $X in stalled pipeline"
- "New EU AI Act requirements effective Q2 2025"
- Limited "founding customer" slots with lifetime pricing

### Q: What's the optimal pricing strategy for validation?
**A:** Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter:
- Start high ($2,000/month), negotiate down to find floor
- Offer 50% discount for 6-month commitment + case study
- Target 3x CAC payback in 12 months

## PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

### Q: How do I balance feature requests vs. core product vision?
**A:** Amazon's "Working Backwards" approach:
1. Write the press release first
2. Every feature must ladder up to that press release
3. Use "RICE" scoring: Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort
4. Say "not yet" instead of "no"

### Q: What technical architecture enables fastest iteration?
**A:** Stripe/Twilio's API-first approach:
- **Backend:** Supabase/PostgreSQL + FastAPI
- **Frontend:** Next.js + Vercel
- **AI:** OpenAI API with fallback to Claude
- **Integrations:** Zapier/Make.com before native builds
Ship weekly, measure everything.

### Q: When should I refactor vs. push forward?
**A:** LinkedIn's "Technical Debt Budget":
- Allocate 20% of time to debt reduction
- Refactor only when it blocks customer acquisition
- Document everything in Notion for future hires

## CUSTOMER DEVELOPMENT

### Q: How do I get meetings with sales leaders at target companies?
**A:** Aaron Ross's "Predictable Revenue" approach:
1. Email CEO/VP asking for referral to right person
2. Subject: "Quick question about [Company]'s enterprise sales"
3. Triple touch: Email → LinkedIn → Email
4. Offer value first: "I analyzed your competitors' GRC approaches..."

### Q: What questions reveal the most about customer needs?
**A:** Clayton Christensen's "Jobs to be Done":
- "When did you first realize you needed a solution?"
- "What did you try before? Why did it fail?"
- "If you don't solve this, what happens?"
- "Who else needs to approve this purchase?"

### Q: How do I handle objections without a track record?
**A:** Use "risk reversal" from Jay Abraham:
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- Pilot with success metrics defined upfront
- "Pay only when you close your first deal"
- Bring in advisors with domain credibility

## METRICS & ANALYTICS

### Q: What metrics matter most in validation phase?
**A:** Dave McClure's Pirate Metrics (AARRR) adapted:
1. **Activation:** Time to first value (<24 hours)
2. **Retention:** Weekly active usage (target: 60% WAU)
3. **Revenue:** MRR growth rate (target: 20% MoM)
4. **Referral:** Customer referral rate (target: 1 referral per customer)

### Q: How do I track progress without overcomplicating?
**A:** Simple weekly scorecard (from "Traction" by Wickman):
- Customer interviews completed (target: 5)
- Product demos given (target: 3)
- MRR added (target: $2,000)
- NPS from customers (target: >8)
Update every Monday, review trends not absolutes.

Consider revenue-based financing or accelerators first.

### Q: How do I position against established GRC players?
**A:** Hamilton's "7 Powers" - Focus on Counter-Positioning:

- "Priced for growth companies, not enterprises"
Own a niche they can't serve profitably.

### Q: What moats can a solo founder realistically build?
**A:** Peter Thiel's "Zero to One" defensibility:
